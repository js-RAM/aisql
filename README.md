## Description
Created a games review database that tracks customers, their reviews, and verified purchases. Also allows tags to be linked to games.
## Working Example:<br>
**Question:** What is the highest rated game from verified purchasers?<br>
**Answer:** The highest rated game from verified purchasers is \"Battle Arena\" with an average rating of 5.0.<br><hr>
## Failed Example:<br>
**Question:** Who has purchased the most action games?"<br>
**Answer:** The query you executed returned no results (an empty set), which means that, according to your database, there are currently no recorded purchases of action games. Therefore, no one has purchased any action games, based on the available data.<br>
The question above failed because the sql generated by ChatGPT was searching for a tag titled "action" when it was "Action" in the database.
## Prompting Strategies
I used zero shot and single domain double shot. Interestingly, the single domain double shot was the strategy that was more likely to fail with the action games question. I think this was because it was more likely to follow the prompt strictly. Other than that they seemed to have similar responses
